# Project2
This is a project in STT 3850 (Statistical Data Analysis) from Spring of 2022 at Appalachian State.

In STT 3850, we used RStudio and coded in R to create graphical diagram to summarize large sets of
data. This was the fimla project where we worked a lot with probability. 

This project took place over multiple weeks and was 90% complete by the due date. I have plans to 
look over this and review my skills in R-Studio later.
